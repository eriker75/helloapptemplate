# Development Log

## 2025-08-02

- Project documentation established: `readme.md`, `docs/2025-08-02-supabase-migration.md`, and this devlog.
- Migration plan to remove Supabase logic and use mock/demo data created.
- Next: Audit codebase for Supabase usage and begin progressive migration.

## 2025-08-02 (cont.)

- Completed full migration from Supabase to mock/demo data:
  - All Supabase logic removed from users, chat, and storage modules. All data access now uses in-memory mock data providers.
  - All Supabase dependencies and configuration removed from `package.json`, `.env`, `app.json`, and the codebase.
  - Supabase-related seeders and config directories deleted.
  - Onboarding and all screens now use only mock data, preserving the original UI/UX.
- The project is now ready for progressive integration with a new NestJS backend, using the mock data layer as a drop-in replacement for future API calls.
