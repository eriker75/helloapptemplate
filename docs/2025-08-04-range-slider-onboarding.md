# 2025-08-04 – Range Slider for Onboarding

## Objective
Create a reusable range slider component for age selection (18–118) using `@gluestack-ui/slider`, styled as per the provided reference, to be used at the end of the onboarding form (`basicinfo.tsx`). The component must be stateless, reusable, and placed in `components/elements/`. It should receive the current value and an `onChange` handler as props, compatible with the onboarding Zustand store.

## Plan
- Review onboarding state management to ensure correct prop types.
- Follow the naming and code style conventions of existing elements (e.g., `CustomInputNumber.tsx`).
- Implement `CustomInputRangeSlider.tsx` in `components/elements/`:
  - Props: `value: [number, number]`, `onChange: (range: [number, number]) => void`, `label?`, `min?`, `max?`
  - Use `@gluestack-ui/slider` for the UI.
  - Style to match the reference: blue track, white thumbs, 18 on left, ∞ (for 118) on right.
  - Stateless and fully controlled by props.
- Document usage in the file.
- Update this doc and `devlog.md` upon completion.

## Files to Modify/Create
- `components/elements/CustomInputRangeSlider.tsx` (new)
- `docs/2025-08-04-range-slider-onboarding.md` (this file)
- `docs/devlog.md` (summary after completion)

## Observations
- The onboarding store uses `ageRangePreference: [number, number]` and `setAgeRangePreference`.
- The component will be reusable for other range selection needs.
- No code duplication; follows project UI and documentation standards.
